# TODO for Up and Away

Current Development Phase: Horrors in the Sky

+ **Current Developments:*

	-- Debug's List

	+ Random horizontal flipping of jellyshrooms to reduce repetiveness.
	+ Allow for more cloud stuff in the overworld, and vice-versa.
	+ Bean Giant fight implementation. Groan.
	+ Winnie character art implementation.
	+ Quartz Torch placable into quartz lamps, givable to entities to increase reputation with that faction.
	+ Rubber trees that gnomes worship. 
	+ Meat wall. Max level monstermeat wall has attacks.s

+ **Current bugs:**

    + Attempting to use Obisidian Staff in the cloudrealm results in a crash.
	+ Winnie's meatbulb recipe is visible to anyone.
	+ Quartz torch errors.
	+ Datura's do not have anim for 9 and 10.
	+ Sparks are broken, no anim.
	+ Side-facing textures for cotton hat are bugged.\
	+ Marshmallow bees are buggy. Very buggy.

+ **Art assets in need of attention**

	+ Check our [dedicated TODO list](TODO_ART.md).

+ **Code assets in need of attention**

	+ Add ambiant sound to the cloudrealm. Sounds now exist in mod files.
	+ Bean Giant needs to be overhauled.
	+ Shopkeeper needs the Boss Quest implementation.
	+ Gnomes need to be overhauled.
	+ Port golden egg corruption to DST.
	+ Superconductor implementation.
	+ Unique item implementation.

+ ** Strings in need of attention**

	+ New stuff.

+ **Miscellanea (Suggestions to be considered) **

	+ Clockwork biome: http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/?p=507711 (This is something I've thought more about. The player should have something more easily relateable once they make some progress in the Cloudrealm. Doesn't have to be clockwork stuff necessarily. Consider it pavlovion. Not that I want the mod to become a skinner-box, but that kind of attribute is necessary to a point in design and balance.)

	+ Stuffed animals that can be created with the sewing kit. They start as a cotton frame, and become a random stuffed animal when sewn. They give very small amounts of sanity and warmth when used. 

	+ Rhinomen confirmed. http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/19488-dont-starve-supermod-mod-abandoned/page-47#entry192646
	http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/3988-the-majestic-rhino-tribe/

	+ Cooked foods. http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/27648-suggestions-cauldron-of-ideas/page-56?p=500493#entry500493

	+ Gummybear traps.

Anything else that needs to be added will be added (eventually).
