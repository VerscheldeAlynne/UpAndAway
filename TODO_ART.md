# TODO for Up and Away art

### Overhauls / Variants (low priority by nature):
+ Tea Bush?
+ Thunder Tree (Currently an atlas swap of spiked tree)
+ Bean Huts (Need variety in shape/design)
+ Crystals (Need variety in shape/design)
+ Weaver Nest (Total redesign. More like trees, the trees grow the nests like fruit.)
+ Algae (Total redesign)
+ Coral (Adjustment and/or redesign)
+ Dragonblood Log (Adjustment and/or redesign)
+ Duckraptor.

### Inventory images in need of attention, in order of priority.
+ Various Potion Types -- Vivalavie was working on these last I checked.
+ Grilled Pineapple and dropped variant --See miscellanea.

### Custom animation banks/builds in need of attention, in order of priority.
+ Sheep -- Needs shaved art.
+ Gnomes. -- Vivalavie was working on this. Battal began animations. Unknown status.
+ Cauldron -- Needs animations for brewing and for brewing completion. Bubbling liquid in cauldron will be a FX prefab.
+ Crystal Armor -- Needs inventory, ground and wearing images, or at least they are not in the mod yet.
+ Birds of Paradise -- There is existing art and some basic animations. Currently virtually no code.
+ Semiconductor Boss -- Lord Battal is working on this. It needs polishing. If you need to know what animations it needs, let us know. We're still figuring out this fight anyways, which is why it's low on priority list.

### Entities with no art assets and undefined status (between using custom animations or not)
+ Mantas. -- Postponed
+ Rainbowcoons -- Postponed
